# CASM-Smart-Phase

## 0.1.2

- Fix bug in generate-bed output

## 0.1.1

- Add option to mark homozygous in the bed generation step.

Smart-phase doesn't phase homozygous changes, so we merge these in manually using the marked bed file at the
merged vcf step

## 0.1.0

- Add [smart-phase v1.2.0](https://github.com/paulhager/smart-phase) to Docker

## 0.0.1

- First release, no Smart-Phase, only utility python scripts
